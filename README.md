This project is called Mental Metric. This project calculates how the user feels in a day and generates a set of recommendations based on the algorithm's understanding of the user mood. 
Recommendations include products, services, and activities that align with their emotional well-being or are believed to improve the user condition. 
Mental Metric is accessible to all individuals, including those who are neurodivergent, as it is designed to be inclusive and accommodating to diverse needs.

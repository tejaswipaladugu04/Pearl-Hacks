This project is called Mental Metric. This project calculates how the user feels in a day and generates a set of recommendations based on the algorithm's understanding of the user mood. 
Recommendations include activities and other suggestions that align with their emotional well-being or are believed to improve the user condition. 
The check-ins also generate line graphs for stress levels and happiness levels which help the user see how their emotions are fluctuating. 
Mental Metric is accessible to all individuals, including those who are neurodivergent, as it is designed to be inclusive and accommodating to diverse needs.
It provides a valuable tool for tracking emotions, journaling, and offering specialized feedback to effectively manage their emotional well-being. 
Research shows that the ability for neurodivergent individuals to keep track of their emotions is very helpful as it helps with creating a sense of routine and structure.

        <h3>Who we are:</h3>
        <p>
            We are four sophomores at UNC Chapel Hill studying various STEM fields, including computer science and physics.
            As college students, we understand that sometimes, taking care of yourself and keeping track of your emotions can be difficult to keep up with.
            Thatâ€™s why we launched MENTAL METRIC, a place where you can track your mood with ease and receive wellness tips and recommendations for wellness-related products from us in real time!

        <h1>MENTAL METRIC</h1>
        <h3>Our Mission:</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to enhance users' mental well-being by encouraging them to record their daily emotions. This project calculates how the user feels in a day and generates a set of recommendations based on the algorithm's understanding of the user mood. Recommendations include activities and other suggestions that align with their emotional well-being or are believed to improve the user condition. The check-ins also generate line graphs for stress levels and happiness levels which help the user see how their emotions are fluctuating. 
            Mental Metric is accessible to all individuals, including those who are neurodivergent, as it is designed to be inclusive and accommodating to diverse needs. It provides a valuable tool for tracking emotions, journaling, and offering specialized feedback to effectively manage their emotional well-being. Research shows that the ability for neurodivergent individuals to keep track of their emotions is very helpful as it helps with creating a sense of routine and structure.</p>

        <p>
            We are four sophomores at UNC Chapel Hill studying various STEM fields, including computer science and physics.
            As college students, we understand that sometimes, taking care of yourself and keeping track of your emotions can be difficult to keep up with.
            Thatâ€™s why we launched MENTAL METRIC, a place where you can track your mood with ease and receive wellness tips and recommendations for wellness-related products from us in real time!
